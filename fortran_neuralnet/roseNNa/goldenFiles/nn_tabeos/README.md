This is a .pt file (load it with PyTorch's `save`) that uses the `Net` architecture from the tabulated EOS notebook. It outputs logenergy, logpress, and log values of cs2 for the SLy EOS table (also see tabulated EOS notebook for the specific details). Note that the input values are normalized, the normalization was done in Python using a scaler.transform method, we output the mean and std in that notebook so you can read the constants used for normalization. TODO - update how the normalization is performed.
