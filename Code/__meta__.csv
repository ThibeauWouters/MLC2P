// This directory contains all aspects related to the Python code written for the master thesis. Some older and out-of-use Python notebooks can be found in the Semester 1 directory. Directories starting with "Pruning_" contain the networks and some logs detailing the neuron pruning loop I implemented and ran for a while. The directory "Training logs" contains some logs of training that I might want to reuse (plot again) later on. 
// TODO There are a few models here, with file extensions .onnx or .pth, that I don't explain (I'll need to figure this out myself first).
"Filename","Description"
"performance_models.csv","Contains the performance of two networks: one big network originally trained, and then another that was obtained after neuron pruning was performed on the first model"
"Export models.ipynb","This notebook contains code that allows us to inspect the neural networks inner workings: i.e. their weights and biases, and moreover has some code that explores how we can export these networks in the best way to implement them in Gmunu. Used in the first semester but still needs some updating for the second semester."
"NNC2P.ipynb","Most of the neural network work was implemented in this notebook, such as exploring PyTorch and network setups and experimenting with architecture design. It can still be used to train networks etc, or to go back to see how the code was implemented here."
"Other methods.ipynb","Small notebook where I briefly explore other methods besides neural networks to solve the C2P problem of the thesis. Not really a lot of details and more intended as a brief exploration, perhaps I'll return to this someday."
"Pruning.ipynb","Notebook to run and play around with the neuron pruning scheme that I implemented."
"PySR_demo.ipynb","Small exploratory notebook that tested the PySR package by Miles Cranmer, which implements symbolic regression. It is not a promising direction to pursue for the thesis, but it could still be of interest so I'll leave it here. This demo is not refering to the thesis at all and just implements some basic demo from the Github repo of Miles."
"symbolic_regression.ipynb","Small exploratory notebook that tested the PySR package by Miles Cranmer for the thesis, but it seems that our data is too complex and irregular and hencecannot be caputured by a simple symbolic expression. Deep learning is the way."
"tabulated_eos.ipynb","Notebook implementing and exploring the majority of the work of the second semester. Here, we try to generalize the approaches and results from NNC2P.ipynb to tabulated EOS, which are more difficult but also promise much more advancements in the future with deep learning."
"model.onnx","Good model that I want to re-use later on in the Code directory so it's copy pasted here."
"data.py","Python script that implements everything related to building and working with Datasets. Mainly implements a custom Dataset object as used by PyTorch, that reads in EOS data and processes it, such as normalization etc."
"nnc2p.py","Python script containing most of the neural network work. Note that we usually define the network architecture that we use inside the notebooks and not in the script, as we often still work on this. This script also implements the neuron pruning loop, among others."
"physics.py","Python script containing everything related to the physics behind the problems, such as the equations between the GRMHD variables, and also implements functions that generate the training and test data of the networks by sampling from tabular EOS or sampling from a certain parameter range and then performing those equations on the obtained samples."
"pytorch_to_keras.py","I didn't use this one a lot. It's probably no longer useful. Ignore for now, have to have a look at it and possibly delete it"
