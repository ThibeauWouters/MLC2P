- calls to get pressure and get eps are isolated? Can undo this in the code? At first, no issue - still can have speedup as Python shows... Or can train for the get all one grid, but what is "all"?
- EOS table hdf5 needs to save also ranges of the input variables
- train SMALL neural net to circumvent the rootfinding for Temp
- why are all variables that are in "get" of "inout"?
- for the important order of variables, see get all one grid, they seem to be ordered there
- don't forget energy shift!
- the tabulated eos just gives pointers to the functions eos_get_pressure_one_grid etc
- looking at mod_eos: have to give the same names, and order of the variables?
- a lot of fixme in mod_eos, in tabulated case for the atmosphere -- can this interfere with our results?
- does our neural net take care of atmosphere right now for the simplest case?
- how is CS2 fixed right now?
- can return 0 for "get all" that we don't need/give right now, but do need derivatives and cs2!
- Train on the Hempel EOS
