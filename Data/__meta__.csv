"optimal_neuron_to_prune_original.csv","After neuron pruning was implemented in the thesis, I checked what the performance was of a well-performing network after pruning a single neuron. I specifically wanted to compare this for two cases: (i) pruning a single neuron from the big network I trained originally, without any pruning done, (ii) pruning a single neuron from an already heavily pruned (but refined, so well-performing) network. I observed that in the first case, pruning a neuron hardly affected the performance, while the loss increased for around 2 orders of magnitude for the second case. This CSV shows the first case. The CSV files show for each neuron (specified by their index in the hidden layers, and then index within that layer) the performance after pruning the network and testing all obtained networks on the same dataset."
